# Sentiment-Analysis-using-NLP-and-Naive-Bayes-Classification

Objective:

Here we have 1000 reviews of a restaurant, our objective is to tell about a given review whether it is depicting a positive or a negative sentiment. We can do this using Natural Language Processing which is a component of AI.

Example:
1) Food was really tasty!!  
2) Nice place.
3) Horrible service:(
4) Wonderful atmosphere, must visit!!

Clearly, 1,2,4 are positive reviews & 3 is a negitive review.

NLP: It's the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken & written. Here, in this project we are using Bag-of-words model and Naive Bayes' Classification.
